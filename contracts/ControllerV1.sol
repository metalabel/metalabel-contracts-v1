Deployed by Metalabel with 💖 as a permanent application on the Ethereum blockchain.

Metalabel is a growing universe of tools, knowledge, and resources for
metalabels and cultural collectives.

Our purpose is to establish the metalabel as key infrastructure for creative
collectives and to inspire a new culture of creative collaboration and mutual
support.
